# Dataset Installation

Use `pip` to install the ```dmba``` package from pypi (https://pypi.org/project/dmba/).

```pip install dmba```

Should this not work, for example when you are behind a firewall, download the package from pypi and install from file, e.g.

```pip install dmba-0.0.14.tar.gz```
